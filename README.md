## Features

- **Automated README Generation** – Simply provide a repository link, and the app will generate a detailed `README.md` file.
- **Code Analysis** – The app inspects the repository's structure and content to extract relevant information.
- **Machine Learning Insights** – Uses AI to interpret project functionality and suggest key documentation sections.
- **Customizable Output** – Users can modify and refine the generated README before finalizing it.
- **Django-Powered Web App** – Built with Django, the app is hosted online and accessible via a user-friendly interface.
